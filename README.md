# Connect Four

## Overview 
This program is a **text-based implementation of the classic game Connect Four** written in C++.
The program simulates a two-player game where users alternate turns, dropping pieces into a grid. The program handles move validation, board updates, and win detection through console interaction.

The project emphasizes **modular program design, 2D array manipulation, and control-flow-driven game logic.** 

## Features
- Two-player, turn-based gameplay
- 2D grid-based board representation
- Input validation for legal moves
- Automatic turn switching between players
- Win detection across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions
- Console-based visualization of the game board
